/* this question can be solved using size as well but for that we require two traversals of linked list
 the easiest way is to apply two pointers standing at head front ;

 void kthfromend(int k){
        
        Node *slow = head;
        Node *fast = head;
        for(int i=0; i<k; i++)
          fast = fast->next;
          
        while(fast->next!=NULL){
            fast = fast->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }
        cout<<slow->data<<endl;
    }
