/*1. You are given two strings s1 and s2.

3. Two strings are called isomorphic if -
   -> Every character of s1 can be mapped with characters of s2.
   -> A character of s1 can be mapped to only one character.
   -> All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.*/
