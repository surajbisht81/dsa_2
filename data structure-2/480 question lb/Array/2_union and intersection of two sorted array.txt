Union of arrays arr1[] and arr2[]

To find union of two sorted arrays, follow the following merge procedure : 
 

1) Use two index variables i and j, initial values i = 0, j = 0 
2) If arr1[i] is smaller than arr2[j] then print arr1[i] and increment i. 
3) If arr1[i] is greater than arr2[j] then print arr2[j] and increment j. 
4) If both are same then print any of them and increment both i and j. 
5) Print remaining elements of the larger array.

Time Complexity : O(m + n)
Handling duplicates in any of the array : Above code does not handle duplicates in any of the array. To handle the duplicates, just check for every element whether adjacent elements are equal.

Intersection of arrays arr1[] and arr2[]

To find intersection of 2 sorted arrays, follow the below approach : 
 

1) Use two index variables i and j, initial values i = 0, j = 0 
2) If arr1[i] is smaller than arr2[j] then increment i. 
3) If arr1[i] is greater than arr2[j] then increment j. 
4) If both are same then print any of them and increment both i and j.

Time Complexity : O(m + n)

Handling duplicate in Arrays :
Above code does not handle duplicate elements in arrays. The intersection should not count duplicate elements. To handle duplicates just check whether current element is already present in intersection list
